# Introduction

Late last week the first people were receiving emails confirming who was selected for Phase 2 of the [Google Africa Certifications Scholarship](https://africa.googleblog.com/2019/04/advance-your-career-with-google-africa.html) program. I was lucky enough to find out the weekend that I was also one of the 10,000 or so students that have been selected for Phase 2. Phase 1 was quite the challenge to focus on both the course content and the 2 Andela MyGradr challenges that we had to complete. Congratulations to all of those that also made it to the next phase of the Scholarship program.

## Pluralsight Courses

Since I am in the Web Track I will be including only the Web Courses for Phase 2 here. Now that we are only 10,000 students in the Phase 2 of the Google Scholarship we have fewer courses but the courses are more focused on Angular and Web Security.

* [Good Parts of JavaScript and the Web](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/good-parts-javascript-web/table-of-contents)
* [Angular Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
* [Play by Play: Modern Web Security Patterns](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/play-by-play-modern-web-security-patterns/table-of-contents)
* [Unit Testing Angular](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/unit-testing-angular/table-of-contents)
* [Play by Play: Owasp Top Ten 2017](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/play-by-play-owasp-top-ten-2017/table-of-contents)
* [Hack Yourself First: How to go on the Cyber-Offense](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/hack-yourself-first/table-of-contents)

The courses are split across 2 Pluralsight Channels that you need to join.

* [Mobile Web Specialist Learning Phase 2 Main Track](https://app.pluralsight.com/channels/details/d1341a43-3766-475d-bea9-f7b45222fd65)
* [Mobile Web Specialist Learning Phase 2 Deep Dive](https://app.pluralsight.com/channels/details/f8278ecb-d711-4cd0-9d26-21f27b8cf0e2)

### What is next?

If you have been selected for the Phase 2 of the Scholarship program but you haven't joined the Phase 2 Slack yet you can use this [link](https://alc4slack-invite.firebaseapp.com/) to generate an invite to the ALC 4 Phase 2 Slack. We also have a Andela onboarding live stream on Zoom this week that will go into more details on what will be expected of us in this phase. The live stream will be on Friday, 23 August 2019 at 3PM GMT. The link to the Zoom call is [here](https://andela.zoom.us/j/383583000). So for now you can focus on the Pluralsight course content as that is available at the moment since we have to wait for the onboarding live stream.
