# Introduction

Late last week the first people were receiving emails confirming who was selected for Phase 2 of the [Google Africa Certifications Scholarship](https://africa.googleblog.com/2019/04/advance-your-career-with-google-africa.html) program. I was lucky enough to find out the weekend that I was also one of the 10,000 or so students that have been selected for Phase 2. Phase 1 was quite the challenge to focus on both the course content and the 2 Andela MyGradr challenges that we had to complete. Congratulations to all of those that also made it to the next phase of the Scholarship program.

## Pluralsight Courses

Since I am in the Web Track I will be including only the Web Courses for Phase 2 here. Now that we are only 10,000 students in the Phase 2 of the Google Scholarship we now have fewer courses but the courses are more focused on Web Security and Angular.

* [Good Parts of JavaScript and the Web](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/good-parts-javascript-web/table-of-contents)
* [Angular Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
* [Play by Play: Modern Web Security Patterns](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/play-by-play-modern-web-security-patterns/table-of-contents)
* [Unit Testing Angular](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/unit-testing-angular/table-of-contents)
* [Play by Play: Owasp Top Ten 2017](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/play-by-play-owasp-top-ten-2017/table-of-contents)

The courses are split across 2 Pluralsight Channels that you need to join.
