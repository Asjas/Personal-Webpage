## Introduction

We just had the first Global Meetup for Andela ALC 4.0 on Saturday the 29th of June 2019. It was live-streamed on
YouTube to all the learners who could not attend the physical meetups. This allowed mentors from the Mobile Web
Specialist Track, Android Track and Cloud Developer Track to walk through the Pluralsight content and to explain to the
learners what should be focused on. This also allowed us to share extra information and links to the learners and to
answer any questions that they might have. I will be including the YouTube video here in this blog post if you missed it
or if you want to watch it again.

### My thoughts

So I was asked to do the Mobile Web Specialist section of the live-stream. This was the first public live-stream that
I've ever done. I've been in online meetings before on Google Hangouts as well as Zoom but those usually consists of 4
to 7 people. This was in front of hundreds of learners that was listening to me and I can honestly say that I was a
nervous wreck during the entire live-stream. I am a very critical person and I also have a lot of doubts about my skill
as a Web Developer (Imposter Syndrome).

Even though I felt like I flopped a bit and could have done a better job, I do feel that I provided valuable information
and resources to the learners. I also answered questions that came up a lot in Slack the last few weeks as well as
questions asked in the YouTube chat. Hopefully this is the start of more live-streaming and that I become much better at
doing this. I am very thankful for Andela for providing me with the opportunity to do the Mobile Web Specialist section
of the live-stream. I also know that a lot of the learners are also thankful that Andela provided this live-stream as a
opportunity for those who were unable to attend the physical meetups.

I sent out a tweet a few days ago asking if learners would enjoy a more consistent Coding / QA live-stream and the
consensus is that it would be a really good thing.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    I&#39;m thinking about starting a YouTube live-stream where I can explain different topics and answer questions
    about the Web Specialist Track. What do you think about me doing something like this?

I just need to get my system up and running for live-streams and I need to figure out how this will be done. I will also
work out a plan for what we will be working on during the live-streams. In the beginning I think we will work through
sections of the Pluralsight projects and the basics of gettting started with a new project. Later we can dive into more
advanced topics in the live-streams.

#### Resources

So during the live-stream I did show and share a lot of extra resources for the Mobile Web Specialist track. I am
including the links here in this blog post for any learners who want to use those resources. I am also including a few
extra resources that can be beneficial to those learning Web Development.

##### More Information

There have been a few recurring questions that come up either in Slack or on the
[ALC Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/362243964404032/?fref=nf) page. I'm going to give general information and
links about our ALC Scholarship program for anyone that still needs it.

1. If you need to generate a ALC Slack Invite use [this link](https://alc4slack-invite.firebaseapp.com/).
2. There is a [ALC Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/362243964404032/?fref=nf) you can join as well.
3. If you need to download the course videos to watch offline you must only use the
   [Pluralsight Official Downloaders](https://www.pluralsight.com/product/downloads). Using third-party services can get
   your Pluralsight account banned and subsequently disqualified for the Scholarship. The offline progress will sync
   online when you are connected to the internet.

   get more information about how the phases will work and what will be required of us in each phase of the Scholarship.
5. If you need to retake the Skill IQ Tests for the HTML, CSS and JavaScript Paths you need to make sure that you are
   confident that you have studied for the test. If you do not have the option to take an IQ test then you do not
   currently qualify for a retake. You can read
   [this](https://help.pluralsight.com/help/how-can-i-re-measure-my-skill-iq) Pluralsight link on how to qualify for a
   Skill IQ retake test.
6. Our Pluralsight subscription for this ALC 4.0 Scholarship ends on 15 January 2020. After that you will lose access to
   all the content online and what has been downloaded offline. You will have to pay a monthly subscription to continue
   having access to the Pluralsight content.
