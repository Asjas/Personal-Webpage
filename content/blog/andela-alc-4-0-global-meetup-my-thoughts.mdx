## Introduction

We just had the first Global Meetup for Andela ALC 4.0 on Saturday the 29th of June 2019. It was live-streamed on YouTube to all the learners who could not attend the physical meetups. This allowed mentors from the Mobile Web Specialist Track, Android Track and Cloud Developer Track to walk through the Pluralsight content and to explain to the learners what should be focused on. This also allowed us to share extra information and links to the learners and to answer any questions that they might have. I will be including the YouTube video here in this blog post if you missed it or if you want to watch it again.

### My thoughts

So I was asked to do the Mobile Web Specialist section of the live-stream. This was the first public live-stream that I've ever done. I've been in online meetings before on Google Hangouts as well as Zoom but those usually consists of 4 to 7 people. This was in front of hundreds of learners that was listening to me and to say that I was a nervous wreck is an understatement. I am a very critical person and I have a lot of doubts about my skill and myself (Imposter Syndrome). I am also very shy and withdrawn so this wasn't very easy for me to do.

Even though I felt like I flopped a bit and could have done a better job, I do feel that I provided information and resources to the learners. I also answered questions that came up a lot in Slack the last few weeks as well as questions asked in the YouTube chat. Hopefully this is the start of more live-streaming and that I become much better at doing this. I am very thankful for Andela for providing me with the opportunity to do the Mobile Web Specialist section of the live-stream. I also know that a lot of the learners are also thankful that Andela provided this live-stream as a opportunity for learners to get more information and resources as well as to have their questions answered.

I sent out a tweet a few days ago asking if learners would enjoy a more consistent Coding / QA live-stream and the consensus is that it would be a really good thing. I just need to get my system up and running for live-streams and I need to figure out how this will be done. I will also work out a plan for what we will be doing during the live-streams. In the beginning I think we will work through sections of the Pluralsight projects and the basics of gettting started with a new project. Later we can dive into more advanced topics in the live-streams.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m thinking about starting a YouTube live-stream where I can explain different topics and answer questions about the Web Specialist Track. What do you think about me doing something like this?<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/150DaysOfALC4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#150DaysOfALC4</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ALCwithGoogle?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ALCwithGoogle</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GrowWithGoogle?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GrowWithGoogle</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Andela?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Andela</a></p>&mdash; A-J Roos (@_asjas) <a href="https://twitter.com/_asjas/status/1144666055882809344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2019</a></blockquote>

#### Resources

So during the live-stream I did show and share a lot of extra resources for the Mobile Web Specialist track. I am including the links here in this blog post for any learners who want to use those resources. I am also including a few extra resources that can be beneficial to those learning Web Development.

##### More Information

So there have been a few recurring questions that come up either in Slack or on the [ALC Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/362243964404032/?fref=nf) page. I'm going to repeat some of the information about our ALC Scholarship program here for anyone that still needs it.

1. If you need to generate a ALC Slack Invite use [this link](https://alc4slack-invite.firebaseapp.com/).
2. There is a [ALC Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/362243964404032/?fref=nf) you can join as well.
3. If you need to download the course videos to watch offline you must only use the [Pluralsight Official Downloaders](https://www.pluralsight.com/product/downloads). Using third-party services can get your Pluralsight account banned and subsequently disqualified for the Scholarship. The offline progress will sync online when you are connected to the internet.
4. You can also use the [Pluralsight with Google FAQ Page](https://help.pluralsight.com/help/grow-with-google-andela) to get more information about how the phases will work and what will be required of us in each phase of the Scholarship.
