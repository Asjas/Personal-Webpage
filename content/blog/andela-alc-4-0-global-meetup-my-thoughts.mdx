# Introduction

We just had the first Global Meetup for Andela ALC 4.0 on Saturday the 29th of June 2019. It was live-streamed on YouTube to all the learners who could not attend the physical meetups. This allowed mentors from the Mobile Web Specialist Track, Android Track and Cloud Developer Track to walk through the Pluralsight content and to explain to the learners what should be focused on. This also allowed us to share extra information and links to the learners and to answer any questions that they might have. I will be including the YouTube video here in this blog post if you missed it or if you want to watch it again.

## My thoughts

So I was asked to do the Mobile Web Specialist section of the live-stream. This was the first public live-stream that I've ever done. I've been in online meetings before on Google Hangouts as well as Zoom but those usually consists of 4 to 7 people. This was in front of hundreds of learners that was listening to me and to say that I was a nervous wreck is an understatement. I am a very critical person and I have a lot of doubts about my skill and myself (Imposter Syndrome). I am also very shy and withdrawn so this wasn't very easy for me to do.

Even though I felt like I flopped a bit and could have done a better job, I do feel that I provided information and resources to the learners. I also answered questions that came up a lot in Slack the last few weeks as well as questions asked in the YouTube chat. Hopefully this is the start of more live-streaming and that I become much better at doing this. I am very thankful for Andela for providing me with the opportunity to do the Mobile Web Specialist section of the live-stream.

### Resources

So during the live-stream I did show and share a lot of extra resources for the Mobile Web Specialist track. I am including the links here in this blog post for any learners who want to use those resources. I am also including a few extra resources that can be beneficial to those learning Web Development.
