# Introduction

We just had the first Global Meetup for Andela ALC 4.0 on Saturday the 29th of June 2019. It was live-streamed on YouTube to all the learners who could not attend the physical meetups. This allowed mentors from the Mobile Web Specialist Track, Android Track and Cloud Developer Track to walk through the Pluralsight content and to explain to the learners what should be focused on. This also allowed us to share extra information and links to the learners and to answer any questions that they might have. I will be including the YouTube video here in this blog post if you missed it or if you want to watch it again.
