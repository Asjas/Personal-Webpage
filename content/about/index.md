I am a self-taught Web Developer that loves to work on anything JavaScript related such as working with React.js and Node.js. My favorite is working with Gatsby.js at the moment. Don't worry, I know HTML and CSS too.

I started the journey on learning Web Development in early 2017. I have a background in IT managing Linux Servers, Firewalls and Networking, and I have always had a passion for solving complex issues.
