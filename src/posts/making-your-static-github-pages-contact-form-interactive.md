title: Making your static Github Pages contact form interactive

In this blogpost I will be explaining how to use formspree.io to add a submission form to
your static Github pages. This will work for other static webpages as well.

Formspree.io allows you to add functionality to your static form without the use of PHP,
JavaScript or using a back-end. You will only need to add a few lines of HTML to your form
and voila!

Formspree.io is free for the first 1000 form submissions per month that they forward to
you. After which you will need to sign up for their Gold account.

```js
const b = a;

const b = {};

var x = 'test';
```

```bash
# npm
npm i tippy.js

# Yarn
yarn add tippy.js
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<div id="example" style="display: none;">
  <strong>Bolded content</strong>
</div>
```
