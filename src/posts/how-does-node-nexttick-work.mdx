_**tldr**: A function or functions passed to `process.nextTick()` will be executed **before** the next tick of the JS engine, **not in** the following tick. It can be intuitive to assume that `nextTick` means the following tick but it does in fact execute code before next tick._

## Preface: What is a tick in JavaScript?

Every time the event loop takes a full trip, we call it a tick.

### An explanation of what nextTick does

It's a way that we can tell the JS engine to process a function asynchronously (after the current function), but as soon as possible. There is no way to tell when the function will be executed, but it will always happen before the `next tick`.

This allows you to execute code asynchronously while knowing that in the next tick of the event loop that code will have been executed. So if you are dependant on a function being executed before the following tick but you want it to happen asynchronously then you can use `process.nextTick()`.

This is a code example of how you would use `process.nextTick()`.

```js:title=index.js
process.nextTick(() => {
  //do something asynchronously
})
```

And this code example shows how you would pass a function to `process.nextTick()`.

```js:title=index.js
function log() {
  console.log("I will be run asynchronously.");
}

process.nextTick(log => {
  log();
})

console.warn("This is a synchronous console.log.");
```

In this above code example where we pass the function `log` to `process.nextTick()` we will see warning logged first and then we will see the function being logged.

#### How does nextTick differ from other asynchronous methods?

The Node.js `process.nextTick()` function interacts with the event loop in a different way from how `setInterval` and `setTimeout` interacts with the event loop.

Calling `setTimeout` or `setInterval` will always execute the function in the next tick of the event loop, much later than `process.nextTick()`.
