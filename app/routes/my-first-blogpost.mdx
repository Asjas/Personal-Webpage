# Page title

.tooltip has a much larger z-index than header! So why on earth is the header on top?

## Layer 2 title

To unravel this mystery, we'll need to learn about stacking contexts, an obscure-yet-fundamental CSS mechanism. In this
article, we'll explore what they are, how they work, and how we can use them to our advantage.

### Layer 3 title

Our `.tooltip` element has a z-index of **999999**, but that value is only relevant within the `<main>` stacking
context. It controls whether the tooltip shows up above or below the adjacent `<p>` tag, nothing more.

Meanwhile, in the parent context, `<header>` and `<main>` are compared. Because `<main>` has a smaller z-index, it shows
up underneath `<header>`. All of its children come along for the ride.

We've seen how we can create a stacking context by combining relative or absolute positioning with z-index, but it's not
the only way! Here are some others:

- Setting opacity to a value less than 1
- Setting position to fixed or sticky (No z-index needed for these values!)
- Applying a mix-blend-mode other than normal
- Adding a z-index to a child inside a display: flex or display: grid container
- Using transform, filter, clip-path, or perspective
- Using will-change with a value like opacity or transform
- Explicitly creating a context with isolation: isolate (More on this soon!)
