## This is my Personal Webpage
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Asjas/Personal-Webpage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Asjas/Personal-Webpage)

### This project was built using the following

* Front-End
  * GatsbyJS v2
  * Styled Components
  * GraphQL
* Back-End
  * Prismic Headless CMS (https://prismic.io/)

###

To get the website up and running you can clone this repo.

```git
git clone git@github.com:Asjas/Personal-Webpage.git
```

And then run the following commands.

```sh
cd Personal-Webpage
yarn
yarn run develop
```

This will start a local server on `http://localhost:8000` that you can open to run a local version of my website.
